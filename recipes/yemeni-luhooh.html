            Luhooh لحوح is a spongy Yemeni bread often served with saucy dishes
            like zigny زقتي (chicken with berbere sauce) or layered with a tangy
            yogurt-herb appetizer salad call shufoot. Luhooh is most similar to
            Ethiopian ingera bread. Both breads are thin and spongy in texture.
            ingera bread however has a sour/tangy taste, while luhooh is more
            savory - kind of like a bubbly crepe. Although luhooh is
            traditionally maid for flours and sometimes corn meal, this modern
            recipe has been adapted by one of my aunts who in my opinion, has
            perfected it. This recipe is so simple and fool proof. The only real
            challenge is finding a high quality crepe pan. Cuisinart and Le
            Creuset both have great crepe pans that I've tried personally. I've
            also gone through my fair share of poorly made crepe pans that I
            found for $10 at Marshalls. If you don't want to invest in a crepe
            pan, just use a nonstick pan with rounded edges - it should work
            just fine.

          <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
          <li>1 cup warm water</li>
          <li>1 tsp sugar</li>
          <li>1 tbsp active dry yeast</li>

          <br />
          <li>3/4 cup all purpose flour</li>
          <li>
            1/2 cup pancake mix - I used Aunt Jemima's Classic (not sponsored)
          </li>
          <li>1/4 cup wheat flour</li>
          <li>1 tsp salt</li>
          <li>2 tsp baking powder</li>
          <li>2 cups warm water</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
          <h3>Directions:</h3>
          <li>
            In a bowl, mix sugar into 1 cup of warm water until slightly
            dissolved. Then add 1 tbsp of fast active yeast. Mix gently then set
            aside and allow to froth up for about 5 minutes. If your water is
            not warm enough, the yeast will take longer to activate.
          </li>
          <li>
            In a separate deep mixing bowl, combine flours, pancake mix, and
            salt. Then add the frothy yeast along with its liquid and mix to
            combine.
          </li>
          <li>
            Gradually mix in an additional 2 cups of warm water. Your batter
            should be thin like a crepe batter, If it feels too thick (like a
            smoothie) then add more water, a little bit at a time.
          </li>
          <li>
            Mix in 2 tsp of baking powder then use an immersion blender or
            standing blender to blend the batter for 2-3 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Heat your pan to medium high. Don't be alarmed if your first luhooh
            burns. This is normal until you figure out the right temperature
            since every stove and pan is different.
          </li>
          <li>
            Ladle in 1-2 ladles of your batter to the pan without adding any oil
            or butter. The amount of batter depends on how wide your pan is. You
            want to make sure that the batter fills the bottom of the pan
            without overflowing it.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cook without touching the luhooh. Bubbles will appear on the
            surface. Tiny bubbles indicate that your pan is not hot enough, so
            turn up the heat. You will know when it is hot enough when the
            bubbles on the surface of your luhooh are larger (see video demo).
          </li>
          <li>
            Use a spatula to peak underneath the luhooh. It is ready when it has
            evenly browned - just like a crepe or pancake.
          </li>
          <li>
            Gently slide your luhooh onto the counter that has been lined with
            paper towels. Do not overlap the luhooh because they will stick to
            each other. Let them cook entirely before stacking them.
          </li>
          <li>
            To store, wrap in paper towel or a clean dish towel then place in a
            ziplock after they have cooled completely.
