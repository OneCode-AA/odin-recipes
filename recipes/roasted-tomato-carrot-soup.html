            This soup is perfect any time of year. Including carrots helps
            balance out the acidity in the tomatoes. Your family will love this
            recipe with pretzel crisps or crunchy and melty grilled cheese
            sandwiches.

          <h3>Directions:</h3>
          <li>Preheat oven to 400F.</li>
          <li>
            Add garlic cloves to two layers of aluminum foil, drizzle with 1
            tbsp of olive oil, and wrap tightly in a purse.
          </li>
          <li>
            In a sheet pan, toss quartered vine and plum tomatoes with a
            generous drizzle of olive oil, fresh thyme sprigs, salt, pepper, and
            balsamic vinegar. Add the garlic purse to the sheet pan as well then
            bake until the tomatoes are charred or completely broken down.

          <h3>Tips:</h3>
          <li>
            If you feel like your blender isn't making the soup smooth enough,
            you can pour it through a sieve to ensure no fibers are left behind.
          </li>
          <li>
            To feel extra fancy, drizzle in a tiny bit of extra heavy cream when
            serving and swirl it in with a fork or tooth pick.
          </li>
          <li>
            Serve with hot Parmesan croutons, grilled cheese sandwiches, or
            buttered toast. .
