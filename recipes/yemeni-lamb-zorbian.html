            Zorbian is the Yemeni version of biryani. After testing this recipe
            many times, I've finally perfected it. This dish is time consuming,
            but it is worth EVERY MINUTE. You can make this dish with chicken
            instead of lamb, but lamb is by far my favorite and the flavors
            can't be beat. For the lamb, I highly recommend you use lamb
            shoulder and neck - those cuts will be incredibly tender and
            flavorful. Ask your butcher to cut them into large hand-sized pieces
            with the bone on. Do not make this recipe with boneless lamb - it
            really won't do it justice.

          <h4>Rice</h4>

          <li>3 bay leaves</li>
          <li>1 large cinnamon stick</li>
          <li>4 cardamom pods</li>
          <li>4 cloves</li>

        </ul>

        <ol>
          <h3>Directions:</h3>
          <li>Chop onions into long strands.</li>
          <li>
            In a large and deep nonstick pot, heat olive oil and fry onions on
            high heat until golden brown. Add a tablespoon of salt to speed up
            the process. The onions should look almost burnt on the edges.
          </li>
          <li>
            Remove the fried onion and set aside leaving the remaining oil in
            the pot.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the washed and drained lamb pieces to the hot pot with oil and
            mix around to get a nice sear. Add bay leaves, cinnamon stick,
            cloves, and cardamom pods. The browning will take a while since
            there is a lot of meat.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once meat has a decent amount of color on it, add ground spices:
            cumin, coriander, turmeric, paprika, Sazon seasoning, and salt.
            Continue to mix gradually until the meat is nicely browned - about
            20 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add enough water to the meat so that is it completely covered. Bring
            to a simmer
          </li>
          <li>
            Peel and halve potatoes. If your potatoes are large, quarter them.
            Add the potatoes to the meat and water - make sure they are
            immersed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cover and simmer the pot over medium heat. Check on the potatoes in
            about 15-20 minutes. Remove the potatoes when they are tender and
            set them aside.
          </li>
          <li>
            Continue simmering the meat until it is 80% cooked. A fork should
            pierce the meat easily, but it won't be falling off the bone yet.
          </li>
          <li>
            While the meat is simmer, make the yogurt mix: in a large food
            processor, blend the yogurt, garlic, green onions, and half of your
            fried onions. Set aside.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once the meat has reached 80% doneness as described above, strain
            out the cooking broth and set it aside for later use.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the yogurt mixture to the drained meat and mix well. Cover and
            cook on medium low heat until meat is 100% cooked and falling off
            the bone when poked with a fork. Turn off the heat while you prepare
            the rice.
          </li>
          <li>
            Prepare the rice: In a large pot, boil 8 cups of water with the bay
            leaves, cinnamon, cloves, and cardamom. Add washed basmati rice and
            parboil till it is 75% cooked. The rice should plump up but it'll
            still feel raw when you try biting into it. Strain the rice out and
            remove the whole spices.
          </li>
          <li>
            Assemble: Add the cooked potatoes over the meat then spread the rice
            over it. Pour the reserved meat broth over the rice until it barely
            covers the top of the rice (about 3 cups).
          </li>
          <li>
            Cover the pot and bring down the heat to the lowest setting
            possible. Cook until the liquid completely gets soaked up. Turn off
            the heat once you can't see anymore liquid and leave the lid covered
            for 10-15 minutes for the rice to continue steaming.
          </li>
          <li>
            Prepare a large serving dish and gently dump the rice and meat into
            the dish. Garnish with the leftover fried onions and chopped
            parsley.
          </li>
          <li>
            Serve with Yemeni zahawig (salsa) and a freshly chopped salad.

          <h3>Tips</h3>
          <li>
            If you don't have Sazon seasoning, replace with Montreal Steak
            Seasoning or your favorite meat seasoning.
          </li>
          <li>
            You can use a pressure cooker to cook the meat quicker. If your
            pressure cooker is not non-stick then only use it for the meat
            boiling stage. Cooking the yogurt in the stainless steal pot would
            likely scald it.
          </li>
          <li>
            To make this dish with chicken, follow the exact steps. Cooking time
            will be much less.
